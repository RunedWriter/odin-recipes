            steak it's going to be...

            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>

        <ul>
            <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp sweet paprika</li>
            <li>1 tsp hosher salt</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>4 sirloin steaks, 1 in thick</li>
            <li>olive oil spray</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Combine the spices in a small bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spray the steak with olive oil and coat both sides with the spices.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat the air fryer so the basket gets hot. For a 1-inch steak, air fry 400F 10 minutes 
                turning halfway, for medium rare, for medium, cook 12 minutes, flipping halfway. See temp 
                chart below, time may vary slightly with different air fryer models, and the thickness of 
                the steaks.

                Finish with a pinch of more salt and black pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let it rest, tented with foil 5 minutes before slicing.
            </li>
            <li>
                Enjoy!
