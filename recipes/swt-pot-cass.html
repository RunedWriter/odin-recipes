            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>

        <p>Pecan Topping</p>

        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped pecans</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Directions</strong></p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 325 F
            </li>
            <li>
                Prepare sweet potatoes: Put sweet potatoes in a medium saucepan and cover with water. 
                Cook over medium-high heat until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and transfer to a 
                large bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mash drained sweet potatoes with a fork. Add eggs; mix until well combined. Add sugar, 
                milk, butter, vanilla, and salt; mix until smooth. Transfer to a 9x13-inch baking dish.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make topping: Mix brown sugar and flour together in a medium bowl. Cut in butter with 
                a pastry cutter until mixture is coarse and looks like peas; don't overmix. Stir in 
                pecans. Sprinkle topping over sweet potato mixture.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until topping is lightly browned, about 30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Enjoy!
