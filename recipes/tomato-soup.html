        <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Gather all ingredients.
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine tomatoes, chicken broth, garlic cloves, and a large slice of onion in a stockpot 
                over medium heat. Bring to a boil, and gently simmer for about 20 minutes to blend flavors.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove from heat and run the mixture through a food mill into a large bowl, or pan. 
                Discard any stuff left over in the food mill.
            </li>
            <li>
                Melt butter over medium heat in the now empty stockpot. Stir in flour to make a roux by 
                cooking, whisking constantly, until mixture turns medium brown.
            </li>
            <li>
                Gradually whisk in a bit of the tomato mixture to prevent lumps from forming, then stir 
                in the rest.
            </li>
            <li>
                Season with sugar and salt to taste
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve and enjoy!
