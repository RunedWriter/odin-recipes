        <h2>Flacky, delicious salmon served with citrus and miso. Bang bang-roasted brussles served on side.</h2>

        <p>
            "Sometimes, there's such a good idea right under our noses, that we're surprised we hadn't 
            thought of it before. Like pairing a flaky, perfect salmon withâ€¦ citrus and miso? Lemon 
            and lime, two stalwart citrus stars, combine with earthy miso paste to form a dressing-like 
            sauce that's like manna from heaven. The other thought that came to us was combining bang 
            bang sauce, known for its pairing with shrimp, with Brussels sprouts, giving the veggies a 
            bit of a kick." - Chef Nigel Palmer. Prep and cook time comes to 30-40 min, recipe serves two, 
            spice level mild, difficulty intermediate.
