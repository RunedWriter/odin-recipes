        <h1>Next-Level Turkey Burgers with Lemon Aioli</h1>

        <p>
            A quick brine produces super-moist burgers with chin-dripping juices. The brining also helps 
            the burgers cook faster, so flip them often to help them cook evenly and prevent charring.
            Active cook time is 1 hr 10 min, total cook time 2 hr 40 min, makes 6.

            <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh oregano</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh rosemary</li>
            <li>1 cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>6 ounces English cheddar cheese, grated (about 1 1/2 cups)</li>
            <li>6 (1/4-inch-thick) tomato slices</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>6 hamburger or brioche buns, split</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons bottled barbecue sauce</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups shredded iceberg lettuce</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Whisk together 8 cups warm water, 2/3 cup salt, brown sugar, and 1 tablespoon lemon juice 
                in a large bowl or pot until salt and sugar dissolve. Add turkey and chicken. Cover and 
                chill 1 hour and 30 minutes. Place a colander in sink; drain meat in colander, rinse with 
                fresh water, and set meat aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                While meat chills, process onion, garlic, and jalapeño in a food processor until very 
                finely chopped, about 10 seconds. Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium. Add onion 
                mixture and a pinch of salt; cook, stirring often, until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. 
                Stir in parsley, oregano, and rosemary; cook, stirring constantly, 1 minute. Remove 
                from heat; transfer sofrito to a small bowl. Chill, uncovered, 20 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir together mayonnaise, 1 teaspoon salt, lemon zest, and remaining 2 tablespoons 
                lemon juice until smooth. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat grill to high (450°F to 500°F). Working in 4 batches, place brined meat 
                in a food processor; pulse until mixture forms a coarse paste, about 7 (2-second) 
                pulses. Transfer to a medium bowl. Add sofrito; mix with hands until thoroughly 
                combined. Shape into 6 tightly packed 7-ounce patties. Grill, uncovered, flipping often, 
                until a thermometer registers 155°F, 10 to 13 minutes. Top each patty with about 1/4 cup 
                cheese. Grill, covered, until cheese melts, about 2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Season tomatoes with salt and pepper. Spread each bun with 1 teaspoon aioli and 1 teaspoon 
                barbecue sauce. Top each bottom bun half with 1 patty, 1/4 cup lettuce, and 1 tomato 
                slice. Cover burgers with top bun halves.
            </li>

                Enjoy!
