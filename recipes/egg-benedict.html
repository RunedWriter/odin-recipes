        </ul>

        <p><strong>For the hollandaise sauce</strong></p>

        <ul>
            <li>125g butter</li>
            <li>2 egg yolks</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp white wine vinegar or tarragon vinegar</li>
            <li>squeeze of lemon juice</li>
            <li>pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>To prepare</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Bring a deep saucepan of water to the boil (at least 2 litres) and add 3 tbsp white wine 
                vinegar. Lower the heat down to a gentle simmer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Break the eggs into four separate coffee cups or ramekins. Split the muffins, toast
                them for a few minutes either side and warm some plates.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>To make the hollandaise</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Melt the butter in a saucepan and skim any white solids from the surface. Keep the 
                butter warm.
            </li>
            <li>
                Put the egg yolks, white wine or tarragon vinegar, a pinch of salt and a plash of 
                ice-cold water in a metal or glass bowl that will fit over a small pan. Whisk for a 
                few minutes, then put he bowl over a pan of barely simmering water and whisk 
                continuously until pale and thick, about 3-5 mins.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove from the heat and slowly whisk in the melted butter bit by bit until it's all 
                incorporated and you have a creamy hollondaise. (If it gets too thick, add a splash of 
                water.) Season with a squeeze of lemon juice an a little cayenne pepper. Keep warm until 
                needed.
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <p><strong>To make eggs benedict</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Swirld the simmering vinegared water briskly to form a vortex and slide in an egg.
                It will curl round and set to a neat round shape. Cook for 2-3 min, then remove with 
                a slotted spoon.
            </li>
            <li>
                Repeat with the other eggs, one at a time, re-swirling the water as your slide in 
                the eggs. Spread some sauce on each muffin, scrunch a slice of ham on top, then top 
                with an egg. Spoon over the remaining hollandaise and serve at once.
            </li>
        </ol>
