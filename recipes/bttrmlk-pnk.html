        </p>

        <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 tsp. baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp. baking soda</li>
            <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
            <li>2 eggs, separated</li>
            <li>4 tbsp. unsalted butter, melted, plus more for serving</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil</li>
            <li>Mayle syrup</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Directions</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a medium bowl whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. 
                In another medium bowl, whisk together buttermilk and egg yolks. As you whisk, 
                stream in the melted butter.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat a griddle or other heavy bottomed skillet over medium heat until hot but 
                not scorching, 2 to 3 minutes. Add about a teaspoon of oil then use a cloth or 
                paper towel to rub it onto the cooking surface until you see no visible oil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Using a measuring cup, ladle as many heaping â…“ cups of batter onto the griddle as 
                you can fit, then use the bottom of the measuring cup to gently spread the batter 
                to even circles. Cook pancakes until you see bubbles form on the top and the 
                sides start to lift from the pan, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the pancakes and cook until 
                the bottom is golden and the cake is fluffy, another 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to 
                a rack. Continue with the rest of the batter, wiping out the pan and adding more 
                oil between batches.
            </li>

                Serve and enjoy.
